# YAML Example Program

Test Pulumi program written in YAML for testing this provider locally.

Edit this yaml program to test features of your provider locally. You can run this program using the following command:

```bash
pulumi login
pulumi stack init local
pulumi up
```

Note that unlike the rest of the auto-generated examples in the ./examples directory, this example is not automatically generated. It is intended to be a place for you to test your provider locally.

The remaining examples are language specific examples derived from the `make gen_examples` command supported in this provider's Makefile. These examples are automatically generated and should not be edited directly. To regenerate these examples, run `make gen_examples` in the root of this provider's repository.
